# Multi-Source Domain Adaptation with Collaborative Learning for Semantic Segmentation
## Problem
- Domain gap between synthetic datasets and real scene datasets -> Mitigate the gap!
-> Training with multiple source -> simply combine all source domains into a single one and train UDA Model

## Goal
: Multi-source domain adaptation framework based on collaborative learning for semantic segmentation
- Adapting models trained on multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain

## In Our paper...
: focus on appearance discrepancy especially color discrepancy between source domains and target domain
1. LAB-based image translation method
	- align the pixel value distribution to reduce the gap between source domains and target domain
	- translate source domain images to the target style by aligning different distributions to the target domain in own color space
2. Collaborative Learning between Labeled source domains
	- to investigate the case of adaptation without seeing any data from target domain
	- Each source domain has semantic segmentation network supervised & an additional soft supervision coming from other models trained on a different source domain
	- Ensemble of models trained on source domains is used to produce pseudo labels for data from target domain in an online fashion
		--> Each model can be additionally supervised by the generated pseudo label
3. Collaborative Learning on Unlabeled Target Domain
	: by additionally constraining the outputs of multiple adaptation models with pseudo labels online generated by an ensembled model
